# Random Forest Implementation

## Overview of the Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm, a powerful ensemble learning method for classification and regression tasks. 
The code is written in Python and uses the Scikit-learn library to build and evaluate the model. 

The goal of this project (Heart Disease Dataset) is to provide an easy-to-understand implementation of Random Forest and showcase its application on a sample dataset.
